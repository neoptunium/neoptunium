## Courses/Services
I currently do courses for HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars, EJS, Node.js, SQL and discord.js, once I learn more languages I will add them to the list. All of the courses cost ($15.00 Dollars USD) an hour, if you have any questions feel free to contact me via discord or email. I will also be taking any requests for services for me to work on projects that you need completed. All prices depend on how much work needs to be done on the project/service. It also depends on if the project needs a hosting or needs any special programs for it. If you would like the project to be done on a certain date/time then you will need to notify me with the purchase so I can start working on it as soon as possible!

If you are interested in buying a course or service please Email or message me on Discord or if you have any questions please contact me and I'll get to you as soon as possible.
